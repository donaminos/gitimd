# gitimd - Get Teamed Up. 
Team-making engine.
Teams can do work without competing in contests.
Teams can join competitions too.

steps:
1. Create a teaming-up idea in the raw and vague sense of an idea. This tool lets you do that.
2. Let people interact with the idea while they become part of a proto-team.
3. Let us all coalesce into a functioning team, where we agree on our focus and then we work with focus.
4. Add a deadline (for a competition or a mutually agreed race against the clock.)
5. Option to progress through these team state stages swiftly or slowly organically.
6. Also need a place for people to go, if they have a non-core role in the team: put them into the ecosystem surrounding the team. "It takes a village to raise a project."

Our inspiration was to solve many recurring process problems that arise when people start getting together to do things in common, in any context outside of the hackathon field. We wanted to make a solution, abstract and antifragile, so that a proposed teaming idea, as a concept, can only be built forward not forgotten not destroyed and so that anyone can use gitimd app to get teamed up in any context.

Next steps: make it clearer that subgroup of the idea-discussing group can decide, elect, choose, or vote to focus on a clear to-be-produced result. In their minds they become the real "team" because they have the same shared clarity. They view all the others as "outer layer" and Gitimd gives them features to support that view. They work and the outer layer acts as an entourage, surrounding, ambiance, environment.
